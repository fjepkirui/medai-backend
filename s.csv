ssessment & Plan:
___ year-old female w/ remote history of early stage RCC s/p
nephrectomy, transferred to ___ on ___ for management of
likely DLBCL with course complicated by AMS, concern for HLH and
TLS, now s/p cycle 1 RCHOP (C1D1 ___ and 1 dose of IT
methotrexate with LP on ___, on cycle 2 of RCHOP with high dose
MTX, course c/b PE, neutropenic fever, and VRE UTI. 

ACUTE CONDITIONS
==================

#DLBCL
#Pancytopenia:
DLBCL diagnosis made from OSH bone marrow biopsy performed ___
revealing high grade B cell lymphoma, CD5, CD10 negative. FISH 
at
OSH indeterminate. On ___ shortly after transfer to ___ she
became altered with ferritin 50,0000, c/f possible HLH.
Transferred to ___ for urgent CVL placement, initiation of
chemo. C1D1 RCHOP ___ (held prednisone, dose reduced 
Vincristine
50% due to liver function). Currently s/p cycle 2 of RCHOP with 
HD
MTX for CNS ppx. Notably, Patient has been experiencing jaw and
cheek numbness. Neuro-onc was consulted on ___ for jaw
numbness and felt that MRI ___ had evidence of meningeal
enhancement throughout cranium, c/f leptomeningeal involvement,
although official read did not support this. Neuro-radiology
reviewed scan again, and did not see CNS involvement (___).
Underwent LP on ___ with IT methotrexate. CSF studies not
significant for lymphomatous involvement of CNS. She is now
receiving HD MTX for CNS ppx. She was noted to have elevated MTX
level at the 24 hour level (11.1), 48 hour level 0.93, and 72
hour level 0.36, 96 hours 0.18 and 120 hours 0.13, 144 hour 
0.09,
168 hour level=0.08. Believe most likely etiology of delayed MTX
clearance is small pleural effusions (on CXR ___ vs anasarca,
other etiology is unclear. She has been receiving Lasix as
needed, more aggressively diuresed on ___ to help w/ MTX
clearance. As she is s/p nephrectomy, she continues on 
Leucovorin
100mg IV Q6 hours. Bicarb IVF discontinued ___ iso downtrending
MTX level. Continues on alternating sodium bicarb tabs and
calcium carbonate Q6 hours until MTX is cleared as on ___. 
She was due for her next cycle of CHOP on
___ but D1 delayed to ___ as she had not completely cleared
MTX. Vincristine held d/t constipation.  

Treatment Plan
-Methotrexate 7140 mg IV Day 1. (___) (3500 mg/m2) 
-Sodium Bicarbonate 25 meq IV Day 1. (___) (25 meq) 
-Leucovorin Calcium 100 mg IV Q6H 
-Alternating sodium bicarb and calcium carbonate for continued
alkalization. 
-PPIs should be discontinued at least 24 hours before
administration of high dose Methotrexate to prevent delayed MTX
clearance.  
-Nutrition order: No carbonated beverages, no citric acid, no
vitamin C  
-Check methotrexate levels daily
-Check urine pH with each patient void  
-Continue ppx w/ Acyclovir/Atovaquone
-Due for next CHOP, plan to resume ___ prior to discharge to
rehab, will then RTC ___ for neulasta and Rituxan
administration.
-Plan for 6 total cycles of RCHOP with high dose MTX for CNS 
ppx.

CycloPHOSPHAMIDE 1540 mg IV Day 1. (___)
 (750 mg/m2) 
DOXOrubicin 103 mg IV Day 1. (___)
 (50 mg/m2) 
PredniSONE 100 mg PO Q24H Duration: 5 Doses 
Give on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
Pegfilgrastim Onpro (On Body Injector)  6 mg SC ONCE Duration: 1 
Dose 
Start: On Regimen Day 1  

#constipation: 
Last BM ___.  Yesterday received miralax and ___.  
Vincristine held d/t concern it would worsen constipation.  
Today received MOM, ___, and Dulcolax as well as a 
suppository.  

#FVO: Weight now downtrending/stable. Likely
secondary to hyperhydration for elevated MTX level. She has been
receiving lasix PRN, most recently given on ___. No respiratory
distress. 
-Lasix PRN
-Trend weight daily
-Strict I+O 

#PE
#Tachycardia: 
Patient noted to have persistent sinus tachycardia on EKG's,
which prompted CTA on ___. CTA was significant for segmental 
LLL
PE, and possible subsegmental LUL PE. Repeat CTA on ___ was
unchanged. She was started on anticoagulation with Lovenox. 
Notably, 
Trop 0.02 with BNP 1050 ___. 
Despite anticoagulation she continues to remain tachycardic,
worsening with postural changes. Repeat EKG shows persistent
sinus tachy w/ PVCs. Echo unrevealing, EF= 77%, trivial
pericardial effusion. TFT's with low TSH, normal free T4 and low
T3. Endocrine was consulted for assistance in interpreting 
TFT's,
per endo, TFT's indicate non-thyroidal illness, and is an
anticipated finding after acute illness, felt this was unlikely
to be etiology of tachycardia. Endo recommended following TFT's
in 6 weeks or after acute illness is resolved. 
-Repeat TFT's in 6 weeks, or after acute illness resolves
-Trend EKG's

#Jaw Pain:
Patient has been having ongoing jaw pain associated with recent
numb sensation. She was initially treated with oxycodone alone,
but given frequent break through use, Added MS contin. Patient
now reporting minimal jaw pain. 
-Continue oxycodone q4h PRN
-Continue MS contin 15 mg BID standing

#CINV:
Stable. Most likely chemotherapy-induced vs. from sodium bicarb.
Suspected CNS involvement of lymphoma raises concern for central
etiology of nausea as well.
-Continue as needed Zofran and Ativan

#CKD
#Hypertension:
Normotensive. Initially antihypertensive was held as she has 
soft
BP's on admission. Had been on irbesartan and labetalol at home,
was started on Valsartan 40mg bid on ___, but transitioned to
home Irbesartan on ___.
-Continue to hold labetalol 

#Anasarca:
Likely due to hypoalbuminemia in the setting of malnutrition.
Receiving lasix PRN as above.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================

#LUE Erythematous Lesions (improved):
Multiple lesions to back of BUE at lovenox injection sites,
therefore most likely is lovenox injections. Less concern for
infectious process given lack of fever. Sites were demarcated,
erythema remains within margins. 
-Alternate lovenox injection sites

#Enterococcus UTI (resolved)
Urine culture from ___ revealed vancomycin resistant
enterococcus. She was started on Daptomycin (D1 ___,
has now completed a ___bdominal pain (resolved):
Patient had vague complaints of diffuse abd pain. She thinks it 
was related to flatulence or anxiety, and improved after
simethicone and Ativan. No further episodes. 
-Continue simethicone as needed. 

#Back pain (resolved)
#Weakness
#Spinal osseous lesions 
#Urinary retention (resolved):
Pt noted to have back pain, diminished rectal tone, urinary
retention, and RLE weakness (unable to lift antigravity) prior 
to
transfer from ___ with known osseous disease demonstrated on
last spine MRI ___ which has likely progressed in time since.
Planned for repeat imaging given c/f cord compression. MRI head
and T/L spine with e/o diffuse osseous metastatic disease. No
evidence of cauda equina syndrome. Patient no longer reporting
back pain.

#Hyperferritinemia
#Elevated LFTs
#HLH
On arrival was stable, although with LDH>6000, elevated LFTs,
anemia, thrombocytopenia. Early afternoon she became altered and
iron studies added onto morning labs returned with ferritin of
50,000, concerning for possible HLH. 45-54% chance this is HLH 
by
H-score, though iso inability to evaluate with imaging/marrow
treating empirically. Transferred to ___ ___ ___, RIJ placed 
and
therapy initiated as above. Other causes of hyperferritinemia
include infection, heme malignancy or AI disease.
-IL2R mildly elevated at 4540
-Repeat ferritin on ___ of 4156 (from 21,000 prior and 20,000
on admission). ___ ferritin of 2677. Repeat on ___
-Continue supportive measures, treatment of lymphoma as above

#Hypocalcemia (resolved): 
Initially Ca ___ at OSH, likely related to bone involvement 
from
malignancy, treated with IVF and zoledronic acid. Subsequently
has been hypocalcemic. Ionized Ca of 1.09 on ___. Repleted with
2g IV Ca gluconate on ___ and ___ with improvement in Ical to
1.14. 
-25-OH Vit D level of 14 on ___ 
-Continue 50,000U Vit D weekly with plan to recheck on ___
(after 8 weeks therapy)

#Malnutrition:
Per ___ nutrition note recommend short term enteral access for
supplemental nutrition support. Likely not a good option at this
moment given her thrombocytopenia and upcoming chemo.
-Continue Magicup tid
-Multivitamin without minerals (per chart there is
cross-reactivity between minerals and peanut allergy).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
[ ] Vit D 50,000U once weekly x 8 weeks 
[ ]  recheck Vit D level after treatment (___)  
[ ] If platelets between ___, give half dose of Lovenox (50mg 
bid). If platelets <30, no Lovenox at all  
[ ] will need repeat TFT's
